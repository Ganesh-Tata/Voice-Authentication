This project implements a **Voice Authentication System**, a biometric security method that identifies individuals by analyzing their unique vocal characteristics. The system primarily operates in two phases: enrollment and authentication.

## System Workflow:

### 1. Enrollment Phase
During enrollment, a user provides several audio samples. These samples undergo signal processing to extract a set of discriminative features (e.g., Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients, or other spectro-temporal features). These features are then used to train a statistical model (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), i-vector, d-vector, or a deep learning model) that represents the user's unique voiceprint. This model is securely stored.

### 2. Authentication Phase
For authentication, the user provides a live voice sample. This sample is pre-processed and feature-extracted using the same methods employed during enrollment. The extracted features are then compared against the stored voiceprint model.

### 3. Verification & Decision
A similarity score or likelihood ratio is computed between the live voice features and the enrolled voiceprint. If this score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the user's identity is verified, and access is granted. Otherwise, the authentication attempt fails.

## Key Concepts:
* **Voiceprint:** A unique digital signature of an individual's voice.
* **Feature Extraction:** Process of converting raw audio into a compact, numerical representation (e.g., MFCCs).
* **Speaker Model:** A statistical or neural network model learned from a speaker's voice to represent their unique characteristics.
* **Thresholding:** A critical parameter determining the balance between False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR).

## Potential Use Cases:
* Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
* Hands-free device unlocking
* Telephony-based identity verification
* Secure access to confidential information
